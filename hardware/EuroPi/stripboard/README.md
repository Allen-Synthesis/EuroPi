# Stripboard Layouts

These designs have been generously provided by [Timmoneer](https://github.com/stripboard-layouts), and the original files [can be found here](https://github.com/stripboard-layouts/lament-for-mills/tree/main/Allen%20Synthesis%20EuroPi).
  
This build hasn't been tested by Allen Synthesis, but has been found to work successfully, so if you are looking to make a lower budget build, or you are looking for a nicer platform to modify the project on, this may be the way to go!
