# PCB Files

The PCB files are in two file types:
- .pcb files, which can be opened in [DesignSpark](https://www.rs-online.com/designspark/pcb-software) free PCB software
- .rar files, which are zipped folders containing the Gerber format PCBs. Each entire .rar folder can be dragged and dropped to a PCB manufacturer such as [JLC PCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) (my personal choice)
  
There are two different options for the panel PCB:
- Panel, which is made for JLC aluminium production
- Black Panel, which is made for FR4 production by any manufacturer
The subtleties of these files are minor, but JLC will only produce the aluminium boards correctly if the layers are in the order that they are in these files, which is silkscreen on the bottom layer and copper on the top.

In line with the license used for the PCBs, if you modify these files before production (rather than just dragging and dropping the gerber files), please contact me if you would like to keep the 'Allen Synthesis' name on it! This is not based in any mistrust of your modifications, but in the risk that someone else might then get hold of these boards or files, turn to me for support, and be disappointed.

If you would rather save yourself the effort of ordering boards (and potentially paying import charges), you can also order Panel + PCB kits directly from me, which will ship with a lower lead time than a PCB manufacturer too!
