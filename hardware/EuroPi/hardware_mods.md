# Hardware Mods

This file documents some common hardware modifications to EuroPi. These modifications are wholly
at your own risk; if performed wrong they could cause damage to your module!

## Alternative to OLED jumper wires

Instead of [soldering jumper wires](/hardware/EuroPi/build_guide.md#oled-configuration) to configure
the OLED, you can instead install a 2x4 bank of headers and use 4 jumpers. This makes it easy to
reconfigure the OLED connection, which may be useful if you ever need to replace the display.

## Reducing analogue input noise

The original analogue input stage, as designed by Ã‰milie Gillet (of Mutable Instruments fame) includes
a 1nF capacitor located in parallel with the final resistor:

If you find your EuroPi's V/Oct outputs are incorrect, or are seeing an undesirable amount of jitter on
`AIN`, you can add a 1nF capacitor in parallel with `R23`. The easiest way to do this is to _carefully_
solder the 1nF capacitor directly to the back-side of `R23`, as shown below:

After soldering the 1nF capactor in place, you should [recalibrate EuroPi](/software/firmware/tools/calibrate.md).
