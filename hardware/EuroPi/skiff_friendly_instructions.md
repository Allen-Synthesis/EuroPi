# Skiff-Friendly Build Instructions

If you have opened this file without being directed here from the normal build guide, you are probably in the wrong place. Follow the normal build guide from the beginning and only access these instructions by clicking the links that say [Skiff Friendly Option]().


### Step 1

1. Instead of soldering female headers as per the normal build, push the Pico onto the board using its male headers only
2. Solder the Pico from the back
3. [Now go back to the normal build](https://github.com/Allen-Synthesis/EuroPi/blob/main/hardware/EuroPi/build_guide.md#large-capacitors)


### Step 2

1. Bend the 7805's legs 90 degrees using a pair of pliers. Look at the photos below to see where to bend them and in which direction
2. Push the 7805 into the PCB footprint and solder
3. You may need to put a piece of tape between the 7805 and the Pico to prevent the metal back of the 7805 from touching the pins or USB port of the Pico
4. [Now go back to the normal build](https://github.com/Allen-Synthesis/EuroPi/blob/main/hardware/EuroPi/build_guide.md#jack-pcb)
