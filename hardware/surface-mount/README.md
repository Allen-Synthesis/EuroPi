# EuroPi (surface-mount)

This is a version of the EuroPi that has all of the components other than the Pico, power header, and panel components pre-soldered using SMD packages. This makes for a much simpler DIY build, as well as a thinner end result. It has identical technical specifications to the through-hole version except for also supporting input detection.

The board files for this version are designed in [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) so are a more friendly starting point for third-party development or modification.
