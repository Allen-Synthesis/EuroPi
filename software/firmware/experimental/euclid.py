    """Generates an array indicating the on/off steps of Euclid(k, n)

    Copied from https://github.com/brianhouse/bjorklund with all due gratitude

    @param steps  The number of steps in the pattern
    @param pulses The number of ON steps in the pattern (must be <= steps)
    @param rot    Optional rotation to offset the pattern. Must be in the range [0, steps]

    @return An int array of length steps consisting of 1 and 0 values only

    @exception ValueError if pulses or rot is out of range
