class NullClock(ExternalClockSource):
    """
    A placeholder replacement for a realtime clock.

    This class sets the base time to 1 January, 1970, 00:00:00.0 and adds the current value of
    ticks_ms() to that time. This allows the RTC to tick up, but won't actually be indicitave of the real time.

    Because ticks_ms() rolls over ever 2**30 ms, the datetime returned by this clock will also roll over
    at the same interval. BUT, 2**30 ms ~= 298 hours, so unless your EuroPi is powered-on 12 days continuously
    this won't ever cause problems.
