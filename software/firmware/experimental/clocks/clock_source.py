"""
Interface for interacting with realtime clock hardware.

For consistency, we always assume that the external clock source is synchronized with UTC. This means
your I2C clock should be set to UTC time, not local time. If you set your I2C clock to local time
some scripts may behave incorrectly.

The Raspberry Pi Pico (and official variants like the Pico W, Pico 2, etc...) does NOT
include a realtime clock. All RTC implementations rely on some external reference time, e.g.
- external hardware (e.g. an I2C-supported external clock module)
- a wireless connection and an accessible NTP server

The external clock source must implement the ExternalClockSource class
