class EuroPiScript:
    """A base class for scripts which wish to participate in the bootloader menu and add save state functionality.

    **Menu Inclusion**

    To make your script compatible with the menu, you must:

      1. import ``EuroPiScript``
      2. define your script as a class that inherits from this base class.
      3. override ``main()`` to define your script's main loop
      4. Surround the call to ``main()`` with a guard to prevent execution upon import

    An minimal example::

       from europi import oled
       from europi_script import EuroPiScript  # 1

       class HelloWorld(EuroPiScript):  # 2
           def main():  # 3
               oled.centre_text("Hello world")


       if __name__ == "__main__":  # 4
           HelloWorld().main()

    To include your script in the menu it must be added to the ``EUROPI_SCRIPT_CLASSES`` list in ``contrib/menu.py``.

    **Save/Load Script State**

    Optionally, you can add a bit of code to enable your script to save state, and load previous state at startup. By default, when exiting the script to menu selection, ``save_state()`` will be called. Additionally, you can add calls to ``save_state()`` whenever state changes.

    When adding ``save_state()`` calls to your script, there are a few important considerations to keep in mind:

        * Frequency of saves - scripts should only save state to disk when state changes, and should not save too frequently because os write operations are expensive in terms of time. Saving too frequently will affect the performance of a script.
        * Save state file size - The pico only has about 1MB of free space available so save state storage format is important to keep as minimal as possible.
        * No externally influenced input - The instance variables your script saves should not be externally influenced, meaning you should not save the current knob position, current analog input value or current digital input value.

    To add the ability to save and load state, you must:

        1. **Initialize base classes** When implementing the ``EuroPiScript`` base class, its initialization method must be called to initialize its intance variables.

        2. **Call the inherited EuroPiScript method load_state_X().** The ``EuroPiScript`` base class has ``load_state_X()`` methods to check for a previously saved state of a specific format. When initializing your script, call ``load_state_X()`` where ``X`` is the persistance format of choice. If no state is found, an empty value will be returned.

        3. **Apply saved state variables to this instance.** Set state variables with default fallback values if not found in the json save state.

        4. **Save state upon state change.** When a state variable changes, call the save state function.

        5. **Implement save_state() method.** Provide an implementation to serialize the state variables into a string, JSON, or bytes an call the appropriate save state method.

        6. **Throttle the frequency of saves.** Saving state too often could negatively impact the performance of your script, so it is advised to add some checks in your code to ensure it doesn't save too frequently.


    Here is an extension of the script above with some added trivial features that incorporate saving and loading script state::

        from europi import oled
        from europi_script import EuroPiScript

        class HelloWorld(EuroPiScript):
            def __init__(self):
                super().__init__()  # 1

                state = self.load_state_json()  # 2

                self.counter = state.get("counter", 0)  # 3
                self.enabled = state.get("enabled", True)

                @din.handler
                def increment_counter():
                    if self.enabled:
                        self.counter += 1
                        self.save_state()  # 4

                @b1.handler
                def toggle_enablement():
                    self.enabled = not self.enabled
                    self.save_state()  # 4

            def save_state(self):  # 5
                # Don't save if it has been less than 5 seconds since last save.
                if self.last_saved() < 5000:  # 6
                    return

                state = {
                    "counter": self.counter,
                    "enabled": self.enabled,
                }
                self.save_state_json(state)

            def main(self):
                oled.centre_text("Hello world")


    .. note::
       EuroPiScripts should not call ``europi.reset_state()`` as this call would remove the button handlers that
       allow the user to exit the program and return to the menu. Similarly, EuroPiScripts should not override the
