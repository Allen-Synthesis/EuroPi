# Itty Bitty

A gate & CV sequencer that uses the binary representation of an 8-bit integer to determine the of/off pattern.

The module has 2 channels, A and B.  Channel A is controlled by `K1` and outputs on `CV1-3`.  Channel B is controlled
by `K2` and outputs on `CV4-6`.

Inspired by an [Instagram post by Schreibmaschine](https://www.instagram.com/p/DDaZklkgzbr) describing an idea for a
new module.

## Ins & Outs

- `DIN`: an input clock/gate/trigger signal used to advance the sequences
- `AIN`: optional CV control for sequence A and/or B (see configuration, below)
- `K1`: determines the value of sequence A: 0-255
- `K2`: determines the value of sequence B: 0-255
- `B1`: manually advance sequence A
- `B2`: manually advance sequence B
- `CV1`: trigger output of sequence A
- `CV2`: gate output of sequence A
- `CV3`: CV output of sequence A
- `CV4`: trigger output of sequence B
- `CV5`: gate output of sequence B
- `CV6`: CV output of sequence B

## How the sequence works

The numbers 0-255 can be represented in binary in 8 bits:
- `0`: `00000000`
- `1`: `00000001`
- `2`: `00000010`
- `3`: `00000011`
- ...
- `253`: `11111101`
- `254`: `11111110`
- `255`: `11111111`

Let `0 <= n <= 255` be the value the user selects with the knob. Every time we receive a clock signal we rotate
the bits 1 place to the left, giving us `n'`:
```
...
00000001
00000010
00000100
00001000
00010000
00100000
01000000
10000000
00000001
...
```

The "current bit` is the most-significant bit.

The trigger output will emit a trigger signal if the current 1s bit is 1, and no trigger if the current bit is 0. The
duration of the trigger is the same as the incoming clock signal (or the duration of the button press).

The gate output will go high if the current bit is 1, and will go low if the current bit is 0.

The CV output set to `MAX_OUTPUT_VOLTAGE * reverse(n') / 255`. The bits are reversed so as to prevent a situation
where the CV is always high when the active bit is also high; this forcibly de-couples the gate & CV outputs,
which can lead to more interesting interactions between them.

### Example sequence

Let's assume sequence 83 is selected. `83 = 01010011`

| Step | Gate (High/Low) | Trigger (Y/N) | CV Out (10V max) |
|------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|
| 1    | Low             | N             | 7.921V           |
| 2    | High            | Y             | 3.961V           |
| 3    | Low             | N             | 6.980V           |
| 4    | High            | Y             | 3.490V           |
| 5    | Low             | N             | 6.745V           |
| 6    | Low             | N             | 3.723V           |
| 7    | High            | Y             | 1.686V           |
| 8    | High            | Y             | 5.843V           |

## Configuration

This program has the following configuration options:

- `USE_AIN_A`: if `true`, channel A's value is determined by `AIN` and `k1` will act as an attenuator for the
  CV signal connected to `AIN`
- `USE_AIN_B`: if `true`, channel B's value is determined by `AIN` and `k2` will act as an attenuator for the
  CV signal connected to `AIN`
- `USE_GRAY_ENCODING`: if `true`, instead of traditional binary encoding, the pattern is encoded using
  [gray encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_encoding). This means that consecutive sequences will
  always differ by exactly 1 bit.

| Decimal value | Traditional binary | Gray encoding |
|---------------|--------------------|---------------|
| 0             | `00000000`         | `000000000`   |
| 1             | `00000001`         | `000000001`   |
| 2             | `00000010`         | `000000011`   |
| 3             | `00000011`         | `000000010`   |
| 4             | `00000100`         | `000000110`   |
| 5             | `00000101`         | `000000111`   |
| 6             | `00000110`         | `000000101`   |
| 7             | `00000111`         | `000000100`   |
| ...           | ...                | ...           |

To enable Gray encoding, create/edit `/config/IttyBitty.json` to contain the following:
```json
{
    "USE_GRAY_ENCODING": true
}

```
