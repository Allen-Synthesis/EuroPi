# Lutra

Lutra is a re-imagining of [Expert Sleepers' Otterly](https://expert-sleepers.co.uk/otterley.html) module.

Each output channel is a free running LFO with a subtly different clock speed. The spread of clock speeds is controlled
by `k2` (and optionally `ain` -- see configuration below)

## Wave Shapes

The shape of the output wave can be changed by pressing `b2` while the module is running. This choice is saved to
the module and will be re-loaded every time `Lutra` starts. Available wave shapes are:
- ![Sine Wave](./lutra-docs/wave_sine.png) Sine
- ![Square Wave](./lutra-docs/wave_square.png) Square
- ![Triangle Wave](./lutra-docs/wave_triangle.png) Triangle
- ![Saw Wave](./lutra-docs/wave_saw.png) Saw
- ![Ramp Wave](./lutra-docs/wave_ramp.png) Ramp

When pressing `b2` to select the wave shape, the selected shape will briefly appear in the upper left corner of the
screen.

## CV Input Configuration

By default CV signals applied to `ain` will adjust the spread of the output waves.  If preferred, this can be changed
to control the overall speed of the waves instead by creating/editing `/config/Lutra.json` on the module.

```json
{
    "AIN_MODE": "spread"
}
```

- `AIN_MODE`: sets the mode for `ain`. Must be one of `spread` or `speed`.  If set to `spread` the spread of clock
  speeds of the outputs is controlled by `ain`.  If set to `speed` the master clock speed is controlled by `ain`.

`ain` is expected to receive signals from zero to `MAX_INPUT_VOLTAGE` (default 12V -- see
[EuroPi configuration](/software/CONFIGURATION.md)).  Increasing the voltage will increase the speed or spread of
the LFOs.  Decreasing the speed/spread is not allowed, as EuroPi cannot accept negative voltages.  Instead it is
recommended to set `k1` and `k2` to set the minimum desired speed & spread with `ain` unpatched. Then send an
attenuated signal into `ain` to increase the speed/spread as desired.

## Knob Control

Turning `k1` fully anticlockwise will set the clock speed to the slowest setting. Turning `k1` fully clockwise will set
the clock speed to the fastest setting.

Turning `k2` fully anticlockwise will set the spread of the waves to zero; every output will have the same clock speed,
(though depending on previous settings and random noise) they may be phase-shifted from each other.

Turning `k2` clockwise will gradually increase the speed of `cv2-6`, with each output becoming slightly faster than
the previous one. i.e. `cv2` will be faster than `cv1`, `cv3` will be faster than `cv2`, etc...

At the maximum clockwise position, the speeds of `cv2-6` will be common harmonic intervals from `cv1`, as shown on the
table below:

| CV Output | Ratio w/ `cv1 | Max speed multiplier |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| `cv1`     | 1:1           | x1                   |
| `cv2`     | 6:5           | x1.2                 |
| `cv3`     | 5:4           | x1.25                |
| `cv4`     | 4:3           | x1.3333...           |
| `cv5`     | 3:2           | x1.5                 |
| `cv6`     | 2:1           | x2                   |

## Re-syncing

When `b1` is pressed or `din` receives a high voltage all CV outputs are temporarily halted. Once `b1` is released
_and_ the signal on `din` drops back to `0.0V` the output signals will begin again, starting in their initial,
synchronized state. This allows a very short gate (trigger) signal to reset all of the waves to re-synchronize them,
or a longer gate can be used to hold the outputs at zero for as long as desired.
