Probapoly creates interesting polyrhythmic gate patterns while also allowing probabilities to be set on gates.
Given values for and upper and lower rhythmic ratios, Probapoly will create a looping pattern as short as possible with no repetition of the pattern within the loop.

Outputs 1,2 and 3 output gates based on the upper rhythmic ratio. Outputs 4,5 and 6 output gates based on the lower rhythmic ratio.

Outputs 1 and 4 always have a probability of 100%. Outputs 2 and 5 have a default probability of 50%. Outputs 3 and 6 have a default probability of 25%.

digital_in: Clock input
analog_in: Different mode, adjusted by setting self.ainMode as follows:
- Mode 1: Analogue input toggles double time feature
- Mode 2: Analogue input voltage adjusts the upper poly value
- [default] Mode 3: Analogue input voltage adjusts the probabilities of outputs 2,3,5,6 sending gates

button_1:
    Short press (<500ms): Reduce pattern length (using manual pattern length is ON).
    Long Press (>500ms): Toggle doubletime feature
button_2:
    Short press (<500ms): Reduce pattern length (using manual pattern length is ON).
    Long Press (>500ms): Toggle Manual pattern length feature

knob_1: Select upper polyrhythm value
knob_2: Select lower polyrhythm value

output_1: Gate upper polyrhythm
output_2: Gate upper polyrhythm (50% probability)
output_3: Gate upper polyrhythm (25% probability)
output_4: Gate lower polyrhythm
output_5: Gate lower polyrhythm (50% probability)
output_6: Gate lower polyrhythm (50% probability)

# Getting Started

The following sections provide instructions for using Probapoly to create some interesting rhythms.

## Initial Connections
1. Connect a 50% duty cycle gate / clock to the Digital input
2. (Optional) Connect a CV source to the analogue input (0 to +5V works best)
3. Connect each output (1 to 6) to modules you want to send gates to

## Creating Polyrhythms

1. Use knob 1 to set the upper ratio and knob 2 to set the lower ratio. Changing these values will cause Probapoly to update the gate patterns in real-time.

The value of the upper and lower values determine the frequency of a gate output based on the incoming clock. A value of 1 will output a gate every 1 clock trigger, a value of 3 will output a gate every 3 clock triggers.

Outputs 1,2 and 3 use the same rhythm, but with probabilities of 100, 50 and 25% respectively.
Outputs 4,5 and 6 use the same rhythm, but with probabilities of 100, 50 and 25% respectively.

See below for some examples.

### 1:$ Four to the floor
upper: 1
lower: 4
automatically calculated pattern length: 4

### 2:3 Hemiola
upper: 2
lower: 3
automatically calculated pattern length: 6

### 4:3 Four over Three (Pass the god damn butter)
upper: 4
lower: 3
automatically calculated pattern length: 12

### 16:15
upper: 16
lower: 15
automatically calculated pattern length: 240

# Example patches

## Polyrhythmic percussion with probabilistic decay and FX movement

This patch will create a polyrhythm with two percussive elements. On 50% of the gates, the kick and tom decay will be changed. On 25% of the gates an FX module will have it's parameters tweaked.

- Connect output 1 to some percussion element (e.g. a kick)
- Connect output 2 to an envelope, connect the envelope to the kick decay
- Connect output 3 to an envelope, connect the envelop to wet/dry CV input on an FX module

- Connect output 4 to some percussion element (e.g. a tom)
- Connect output 5 to an envelope, connect the envelope to the tom decay
- Connect output 6 to an envelope, connect the envelop to another CV input on an FX module

- Set the upper value to 4
- Set the lower value to 3

## Polyrhythmic melodies

This patch uses the polyrythmic gates to advance sequencer clocks

- Connect output 1 to the clock input of sequencer 1
- Connect output 4 to the clock input of sequencer 2

- Create a short (e.g. 4) pattern on both sequencers

- Adjust the upper and lower values manually or during a performance to created interesting and fluid polyrhythmic melodies
