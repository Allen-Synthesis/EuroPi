### General
This script allows users to store any number of presets, with each preset holding a bank of 6 CV values.  
Each preset can be loaded with button 1, outputting its stored CV values on each of the 6 outputs, and button 2 will return to the menu of presets.  
Within a preset, knob 1 scrolls which output is selected, and knob 2 changes the value of the selected output.  
Pressing button 2 while in the menu of presets allows you to rename or delete the current preset. There is a delete confirmation to prevent accidental deletion.
