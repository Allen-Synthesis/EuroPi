Pixels bounce around the display and trigger gates when hitting the edges.
Inspired by the classic bouncing DVD logo!

## Usage

Just boot up the script and you're already going! You can use the knobs to
adjust several parameters. The analogue input can be bound to any of them.
By default, it affects the speed. The analogue input is summed with the knob
value of its affected parameter, meaning that the knob sets a minimum value
for the analogue input to add to. Note that since the EuroPi takes analogue
inputs between 0V and 10V, AC signals must be biased properly or the bottom
half of the input will be clipped.

### Parameters

* *Speed* affects how fast the simulation runs. It translates to how fast the
  pixels move.
* *Impulse speed* controls how much speed is added to each pixel when an impulse
  occurs.
* *Width* controls how wide the playing field is.
* *Ball count* controls how many pixels are in play.

### Impulses

Impulses can be caused globally by pressing B2 or sending a signal to the
digital input (assuming it has not been reconfigured). When an impulse occurs,
velocity in a random direction. The speed added is the product of the impulse
speed parameter and a random number (between 0.5 and 2.0 by default).

### Deactivation

One possible over and under speed behaviour is that pixels are deactivated.
When deactivated, a pixel will not be processed or rendered until reset. Resets
can be manually triggered by pressing B1 or using the digital input (must be
configured). A reset is automatically triggered when all pixels in play are
deactivated. 

## Outputs

* CV1: collision with top edge (25ms)
* CV2: collision with left edge (25ms)
* CV3: collision with right edge (25ms)
* CV4: collision with bottom edge (25ms)
* CV5: collision with any edge (10ms)
* CV6: collision with corner (100ms)

Denoted gate hold lengths are defaults. They can be changed in the
[configuration file](#Configuration).

## Controls

* K1: simulation speed
* K2: impulse speed
* Either button + K1: ball count
* Either button + K2: width
* B1 short press: reset
* B2 short press: send impulse
* Digital input: send impulse (customisable)
* Analogue input: speed (customisable)

Second layer knobs are "locking", which is to say you need to physically set the
knob to a position close to the registered value in order for it to latch and
start changing. This is to prevent abrupt changes in values when you press the
buttons. If you lose track of a knob position, try sweeping the full range to
get it to latch.

The short press threshold is set to 500ms by default. You can adjust this
length in the [configuration file](#Configuration).

The digital input can be set to trigger a reset instead of an impulse. Likewise,
the analogue input can be set to control any of the parameters controlled by
knobs. These behaviours can be defined [configuration file](#Configuration).

## Configuration

The script can be thoroughly customised using a configuration file. The
configuration file must be located at `/config/BouncingPixels.json` on the micro
controller.

## Known issues & limitations

* Gate lengths are not entirely precise. They're guaranteed to be at least the
  set length, but they may exceed it slightly on account of running on 
  tick-based timers.
* Corners aren't actually corners, they're just the top and bottom most
  parts of the side edges. This means that if a pixel is traveling parallel and
  close to the top or bottom edge, it's possible that it bounces away from the
  edge upon hitting the corner collision area and thus triggers a corner gate
  without hitting both a horizontal and a vertical edge. Another consequence is
  that a corner gate will always trigger at the same time as a side gate,
  regardless of whether the pixel collides with a horizontal or vertical edge
  first.
* Collision handling cannot handle a pixel going fast enough to bounce with two
  opposing walls in one tick. If a pixel goes fast enough to do this, it
  triggers the over speed behaviour (i.e. by default, they will reset).
* This script consumes a relatively large amount of memory. Max ball counts over
  100 risk crashing the script. Ball counts over 20 consume enough memory to
  cause connection issues with Thonny. If you need to debug the script, you will
  probably want to lower the max ball count.

## Further development

If you fancy developing this script further, here are a few suggestions for what
you can do:

* Address any of the issues mentioned above.
* Implement gravity! You can add another set of knob banks (let the buttons
  trigger different banks) that control gravity magnitude and direction.
  The tricky part of implementing gravity comes from the fact that a pixel will
  have zero speed at the top of its arc when bouncing in place, and triggers the
  under speed behaviour.
* Allow more in-app configuration instead of relying on the configuration file.
* Implement visual feedback on the locked knob inputs. This would make the use
  of the second layer knobs easier.
