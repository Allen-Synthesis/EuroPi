# Bezier Curves

This script generates two random CV outputs using [Bezier curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezier_curve).

This work is inspired by the [ADDAC507](https://www.addacsystem.com/en/products/modules/addac500-series/addac507),
a collaboration between ADDAC System and [Monotrail](https://youtu.be/9PxVmeMrOoQ?si=GsNDKNipjHtBIPT1)

## Input & Output

The module has two separate output channels, referred to as A and B. Each has identical controls, though channel B's
controls can only be accessed by holding `b2`.  Note that when changing channels, the knobs will "lock" in their
previous positions, so you may need to sweep the knob to unlock it.

- `b1` -- press to change the clipping mode for both channels (see below)
- `b2` -- hold to change `k1` and `k2` to channel B input

- `k1` -- set the frequency of channel A or B
- `k2` -- set the curve of channel A or B
- `ain` -- configurable CV input to control either the frequency or curve (see below for how to set routing)
- `din` -- on a rising edge, force channels A and B to choose new goal voltages. This will not generate an output gate
   on `cv4` (see below), but may change the gate state on `cv5` and `cv6`.

- `cv1` -- CV output from channel A
- `cv2` -- CV output from channel B
- `cv3` -- the average of channel A and B CV outputs
- `cv4` -- gate output of channel A
- `cv5` -- gate output of channel B
- `cv6` -- logic combination of gate outputs of channels A and B (see below for how to configure the logic mode)

Gate outputs are different for channels A and B:
- Channel A (`cv4`) outputs a 10ms trigger every time a new sample is generated (determined by the frequency)
- Channel B (`cv5`) is high whenever its voltage output is higher than 50%. e.g. if the range is set to 0-10V, `cv5`
  will be high if `cv2` is 5V or more.

Patching a clock/gate/trigger signal into `din` will force the output channels to choose a new goal voltage. This can
(and frequently will) cause an abrupt change in the CV output of channels A and B, rather than the smoothly changing
voltages they normally output.

## Additional Configuration

The script has additional parameters that can be set by manually editing/creating `/config/Bezier.json`. The default
values for this file are below:

```json
{
    "MIN_VOLTAGE": 0.0,
    "MAX_VOLTAGE": 10.0,
    "AIN_MODE": "frequency",
    "LOGIC_MODE": "xor",
    "MAX_INPUT_VOLTAGE": 10.0
}
```

The following fields may be set:

- `MIN_VOLTAGE` -- the minimum voltage that channel A or channel B may output. Default: 0.0
- `MAX_VOLTAGE` -- the maximum voltage that channel A or channel B may output. Default 10.0
- `AIN_MODE` -- changes what parameter voltage to `ain` controls. Must be one of `curve` or `frequency`. Default: `frequency`
- `LOGIC_MODE` -- sets the logical operation used to determine the gate output of `cv6`. Must be one of
   `and`, `or`, `xor`, `nand`, `nor`, or `xnor`. Default: `xor`.
- `MIN_FREQUENCY` -- the minumum frequency (Hz) for choosing new random values. Must be between 0.001 and 10.0. Default: 0.01
- `MAX_FREQUENCY` -- the maximum frequency (Hz) for choosing new random values. Must be between 0.001 and 10.0. Default: 1.0
- `MAX_INPUT_VOLTAGE` -- the maximum CV input voltage (default: 10.0)

Note that the maximum and minimum voltages must be defined such that:
- `MIN_VOLTAGE` is less than `MAX_VOLTAGE`
- `MIN_VOLTAGE` and `MAX_VOLTAGE` are positive
- `MIN_VOLTAGE` and `MAX_VOLTAGE` do not fall outside the range defined by the module's master configuration
- `MAX_INPUT_VOLTAGE` is less than the module's master configuration.

See [Configuration](/software/CONFIGURATION.md) for more information on input & output voltage options for the
entire module.

If you plan on using CV to control Bezier, make sure you set the maximum input voltage according to your modules'
output.  For example if you plan on connecting it to an LFO that outputs 0-5V, you may find it helpful to set the
`MAX_INPUT_VOLTAGE` to `5.0` to allow the full modulation range.  If your LFO is bipolar (e.g. `+/-5V`), the input
will be clamped at 0 as EuroPi does not support bipolar CV input.  In this case, the use of a voltage rectifier is
recommended.

## Clipping mode

The output can behave in one of 3 ways if the output wave moves outside the defined maximum/minimum voltage range:
- `limit` -- the output is clipped to the maximum/minimum value
- `fold` -- the output is flipped such that the shape of the curve is reflected
- `thru` -- the output wraps around through the opposite end of the range

## Curve Shapes

The shape of the bezier curves is defined by the "curve constant" `k`. This value lies in the range `[-1, 1]`, and is
interpreted as follows:
- `0.0` -- linear interpolation between voltages
- `k < 0` -- horizontal approach to each new voltage
- `k > 0` -- vertical approach to each new voltage

The following image illustrates this concept, copied from the ADDAC507 manual:
![Bezier Curves](bezier-docs/curve-knob.png.png)

Negative values of `k` will generally result in a smoother overall shape to the output voltage. Positive values will
have more abrupt changes in voltage whenever a new goal value is generated.

## CV Control

If CV control is set to `frequency` (the default), `ain` will accept positive voltage, increasing the frequency of both
channels as voltage increases.

If CV control is set to `curve`, `ain` will accept positive voltage, changing the curve constant of both channels. The
channels' curve constants are set to the average between the knob value (`[-1, 1]`) and the CV value:
- `0V` is equivalent to a curve constant of `-1`
- `50%` of `MAX_INPUT_VOLTAGE` is equivalent to a curve constant of `0`
- `100%` of `MAX_INPUT_VOLTAGE` is equivalent to a curve constant of `+1`
