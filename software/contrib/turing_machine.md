A script meant to recreate the [Music Thing Modular Turning Machine Random Sequencer](https://www.musicthing.co.uk/Turing-Machine/)
as faithfully as possible on the EuroPi hardware. Plenty of information is available at that link, but the most
important bit is this:

  In the Turing Machine, looping is controlled by the big knob.
    * At noon, the sequences are random.
    * At 5 o'clock, it locks into a repeating sequence.
    * At 7 o'clock, it double locks into a repeating sequence twice as long as the 'length' setting.
    * At 3 o'clock or 9 o'clock, it slips; looping but occasionally changing notes.

The left knob (k1) acts as the TM's big knob. The right knob (k2) serves dual duty as the scale and length knob. The
mode of the knob is changed with the right button (b2).

- **din:** clock
- **ain:** cv control over the big knob, added to the knobs value
- **k1:** the big knob (probability that the sequence changes)
- **k2:** output scale (0-10v) or sequence length (2-16 steps)
- **b1:** write (clear bits)
- **b2:** change k2 function
- **cv1:** pulse 1
- **cv2:** pulse 2
- **cv3:** pulse 4
- **cv4:** pulse 1 & 2
- **cv5:** pulse 2 & 4
- **cv6:** sequence out
