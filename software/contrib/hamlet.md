**TB or not TB?**

Hamlet is a drum and voice sequencer based on Nik Ansell's
Consequencer, which is itself inspired by Grids from Mutable
Instruments. It's also influenced by O_C's TB3PO. Hamlet adds two
tracks of CV and gates to the Consequencer, sacrificing one drum track
to do so.

The app provides two gates for drum patterns and a pair of channels
giving gate/CV to drive voices. Density of notes played on the CV
tracks can be adjusted.

Use outputs 1/2 for drum gates. Pairs 3/4 and 5/6 provide gate/CV for
melody lines. Send a clock to the digital input to start the sequence.

# Getting Started

The following sections provide instructions for creating a simple 2
drum pattern with a kick and hi-hat, then using random CV patterns to
drive voices.

## Basic Usage
1. Connect a clock input to the Digital input
2. Connect a Bass Drum to output 1, Hi-hat to output 2
3. Start your clock - the pattern will output gates on outputs 1/2.
4. Select different patterns manually using knob 2 (right-hand
knob). The first section of the selected gate pattern for track 1 is shown visually on the screen.

## Voices
1. Connect output 3 to gate on voice 1
2. Connect output 6 to pitch on voice 1, optionally via quantiser/attenuator.
3. Connect output 4 to gate on voice 2
4. Connect output 5 to pitch on voice 2, optionally via quantiser/attenuator.
5. Gates will be output on 3/4 according to the gate pattern
6. The gate pattern for track 1 will be shown on the screen.
7. Knob 1 increases or decreases the sparsity of the gates sent to
   outputs 3 and 4. Fully CCW all notes are played, as the knob is
   turned CW, notes will drop out of the sequence.

## Sparsity

A key feature of the two voice tracks in Hamlet is *sparsity*
control. With this set to 0, all events in the track are present. As
the level of sparsity increases, the number of gates emitted
reduces. The CV output values will only change when a gate is
emitted.

This is done as follows. Each track has a number of steps, each with a
voltage and sparsity value: here we assume 16 as this is a common
pattern length. Sparsities are allocated randomly from 1 to the length
of the track. When the value selected by the left knob is greater than
the sparsity value, the step is disabled, and no change to CV value is
made. The figure below shows this, with values `V1` up to `V16` being
the voltages in the pattern and the sparsity values shown in the
second row. As the knob value increases, more gates are
disabled. Here, `VX` refers to the CV value that was being emitted
before the pattern started. For example, if the knob sparsity is 10
and the pattern is looping, then `VX` will be `V16`.

Note that every time a CV pattern is created through a right button
press, that pattern will have a new random set of sparsity
values. Note also that track 1 and track 2 have *different* gate
patterns, thus different notes will drop out giving some nice
interplay between the voices.

## Pattern Length

CV patterns are N, 2xN or 4xN steps, where N is the length of the
current drum pattern. This can be varied through a long
press on Button 1, and the display will indicate `1x`, `2x` or `4x`
respectively. Patterns of length 2xN and 4xN will be made up of two or four
(different) N step patterns as described above. So when sparsity is
set to `15` with pattern length `4x`, there will be four notes played
across the 64 note sequence.

## Selecting analogue input modes

Hamlet can perform 3 different actions when a control voltage input is received at the analogue input.
The current running mode is shown on the bottom right of the screen (e.g. M1, M2, M3)
Cycle through the modes by long-pressing and releasing button 2. The following modes are available:

- Mode 1: Randomness
- Mode 2: Control voltage selects the gate pattern
- Mode 3: Control voltage selects the stepped CV pattern

## Controlling a pattern using CV

1. Select analogue mode 2.
2. Send a control voltage into the analogue input

A fixed voltage will select a single pattern and varying voltage (e.g. an envelope or LFO) will smoothly cycle through patterns.

## Adding / Removing / Updating Gate Patterns

1. Update patterns in the code
2. Restart the Europi module, or restart the program if using a micropython IDE/CLI

The syntax is like Consequencer, but with only two tracks.

The mapping of `BD`, `HH` is as follows:
- BD: Output 1
- HH: Output 2

```
    BD.append("1000100010001000")
    HH.append("1111111111111111")
```
