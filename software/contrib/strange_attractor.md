# Strange Attractor.

Strange Attractor is a source of chaotic modulation using systems
of differential equations such as the Lorenz System:

Outputs 1, 2 and 3 are based on the *x*, *y* and *z* values generated by the
attractor.

Outputs 4, 5 and 6 are gates based on the values of *x*, *y* and *z* and
relationships between them.

## Controls

- digital_in: Pause motion when `HIGH`
- analog_in:

- knob_1: Adjust speed
- knob_2: Adjust threshold for triggers

- button_1: Decrease output voltage range; change equation system
- button_2: Increase output voltage range; change display

- output_1: x
- output_2: y
- output_3: z
- output_4: triggers/gates
- output_5: triggers/gates
- output_6: triggers/gates

1. Knob 1 controls the speed. The sensitivity changes at noon, allowing for very slow or very fast
   modulation.
2. Knob 2 adjusts the threshold used for triggers.
3. Short presses on buttons 1/2 reduce/increase the max output voltage of the CV outputs, from 1V
   to 5V.
4. Long press on button 1 changes the equation system
5. Long press on button 2 changes the display between detail and graphical
6. If the digital input is `HIGH`, change is paused.

Outputs 1-3 provide chaotic shifting voltages.
Outputs 4-6 provide gates/triggers.

## Basic Usage

1. Switch on
2. Connect outputs to modules
3. Enjoy randomness

## Details

The attractors can be used to desribe a point moving in 3-D space. The
*x*, *y*, *z* coordinates are then be used to generate control
voltages and triggers.

A selection of equation systems are available, currently including
Lorzez, Rossler, Pan-X-Zhou and Rikitake -- see code for
details. Each has a set of parameters and defaults.

On startup, code runs through a number of iterations in order to
calculate the possible output ranges. This process takes
around 30 seconds per system. This is then used to normalise *x*, *y* and *z*
values to the range 0-100 for calculation of voltages on outputs 1, 2
and 3.

A system is then chosen at random.

Outputs 4, 5 and 6 are triggers, with 4 giving more frequent triggers
than 5 and 6. Output 4 takes the normalised value of output 1 and sets
it `HIGH` if the integer portion is even. Output 5 is set high when
*(y+z - 2\*x)* is above an (adjustable) threshold, similarly for
output 6 and *(z+x - 2\*y)*.

The display will show current values for outputs 1, 2, 3, speed,
threshold, voltage range, triggers 4, 5 and 6 when `HIGH` and if the
movement is frozen.

A long press on button 1 changes the equation system. Note that this
may cause a discontinuity in the x, y and z values.

A long press on button 2 toggles between a numerical and graphical
display

If the digital input is set to `HIGH`, the system will pause.
