# Contributing to the EuroPi Repository

Contributing is welcomed and encouraged for anyone, from programming experts to complete novices.  
This repo is a collection of resources, so if there are any resources that you have created yourself, or found online that you think others would benefit from, then please consider submitting them here!  
  
This process is also what you would use to submit your scripts to the contrib folder; simply complete the steps below, and upload your script and description '.md' file to the contrib folder in your 'fork' in step 3 below.

### Steps to submit a new file or change existing files
1. Create a 'fork' of this repository on your own page by clicking the button that says 'Fork' in the top right, between 'Watch' and 'Starred'
2. Navigate to your new fork by going to your profile. It will be listed as your_username/EuroPi instead of Allen-Synthesis/EuroPi
3. Make the relevant changes to your own fork, either uploading files or changing existing ones
4. **IMPORTANT**: Please write informative descriptions for all commits you make to your own fork so that it is obvious what changes you are making and why
5. When you are happy with the changes you've made, click the tab in your own fork that says 'Pull Requests' and then click 'New Pull Request'
6. Check all of the changes shown below are correct, then click 'Create Pull Request'
7. Add a title and an overall description of the changes you are suggesting and/or the new files you've uploaded.  
This description should be informative but doesn't have to be too long if there are descriptions for each commit (as there should be)
8. Please make sure that the checkbox 'Allow edits and access to secrets by maintainers' is turned *on* so that any small changes, such as spelling or grammar, can be completed by any of the maintainers before merging
9. Any of the maintainers may request changes to the pull request.  
Please do not delete the request if this happens, simply make the changes to your branch, and the commits will show up.  
This is important as otherwise we cannot keep track of the changes that have been requested and completed.  
These changes will probably be basic and minimal, and are usually just to make sure that everything is ready before merging so that nothing will have to be changed later.  
Don't worry if it seems like there are a lot of changes requested, or if they seem a little harsh, every request gets the same treatment, even those of the maintainers!  
If you need any help fulfilling a change request, just add a comment and any one of the maintainers can help you out (this is why step 8 is important)
10. After any changes have been completed, your pull request will be merged, and you will see your changes/new files on the official repository
11. Pat yourself on the back for sharing your knowledge with the community!
  
  
### Tips and things to keep in mind
1. This repository is run mainly by volunteers, with other jobs and families, so your Pull Request may take some time before it's allowed to merge. This will just depend on what other things the maintainers have on at any given time, please don't think anyone is ignoring your contributions!
2. Please try to keep your Pull Requests to as few a files as possible. For example: if you have made some spelling changes to a main file, and are also uploading a script to the contrib folder, please try to separate these into two different Pull Requests so that the workload for the maintainers is more manageable. Keeping each PR smaller will also mean that it will be merged much faster!
3. Comments or reviews on your Pull Requests are *never* intended to be negative, however if you are unused to the matter of fact way that Git reviews are completed it may seem that way. If you believe someone is being genuinely antagonistic, please contact the Rory [via email](mailto:contact@allensynthesis.co.uk) or [on Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/roryjamesallen#6370).
4. If you need any help with any stage of this process (or anything else), please don't hesistate to ask questions in the [Discussions page](https://github.com/Allen-Synthesis/EuroPi/discussions) or email Rory directly at [contact@allensynthesis.co.uk](mailto:contact@allensynthesis.co.uk).
